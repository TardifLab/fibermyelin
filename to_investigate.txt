Q0 see todo list for the code

Q1 in multi-fiber voxels, is it better to threshold the AFDs or to include the fibers with lower AFD in the computation (removing parameters vs. including all sources of signal variation). If we sue a lower threshold, we should threshold afterward to analyze result

Q2 can we do a smooth phase correction in order to complex average human data to reduce SNR and noise floor bias?

Q3 can we incorporate a myelin estimate in NODDI to improve vic estimate?
 
Q4 can we use CHARMED (have the data)? using vic assumes same intra:extra-axonal volume fraction for each fiber.  Could potentially fix the entire tensor for each fiber using CHARMED

Q5 what is our angular resolution? Could we do a simulation based quantitative analysis of this?

Q6 try a different tortuosity model, e.g. Kaden 2016.

Q7 try fitting modifications c.f. Harms, MLE, etc.
